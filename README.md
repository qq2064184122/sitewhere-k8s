# SiteWhere Kubernetes Orchestration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sitewhere/sitewhere-k8s.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sitewhere/sitewhere-k8s)

Note that the SiteWhere Helm charts are no longer necessary for bootstrapping an instance with default settings.
Instead use the [swctl](https://github.com/sitewhere/swctl) tool to boostrap the SiteWhere infrastructure and instances.

For customizable deployments not supported by `swctl` see Helm chart content in `charts` subfolder for manual installation directions.
